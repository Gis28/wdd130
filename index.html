        <p>The Republic of the Congo is located along the equator in Central Africa. It is bordered
            to the
            north by Cameroon and the Central African Republic, to the west by Gabon, to the east by
            the
            Democratic Republic of the Congo, and to the southwest by Angola.
            The Republic of the Congo's area is almost five times that of Stockholm, with a total
            area of
            342,000 km². Brazzaville, the capital, is situated on the banks of the Congo River and
            faces
            Kinshasa, the capital of the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo. Brazzaville
            and Kinshasa
            are the two closest capital cities in the world after Rome and Vatican City.
